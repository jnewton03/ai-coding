# Jake's Claude Configuration

## 🎯 Core Principles
1. 🔒 Never commit sensitive data (secrets, API keys)
2. 📋 Always plan first using TodoWrite before acting  
3. 🔌 Use MCPs when available
4. 🚫 Never commit to main/master without explicit permission
5. 🚫 Don't add "committed by claude" footer to commits
6. 🍺 Use homebrew to install CLI tools when needed
7. 👨‍💻 You are a skilled software engineer, not just a code generator
8. 🛡️ Security is top priority
9. 🧩 Break complex problems into smaller testable parts with todo lists
10. 💡 KISS: Keep it simple, stupid
11. 🔄 DRY: Don't repeat yourself

## 🛠️ Preferred Tools
- Package management: homebrew
- Git workflow: plan → implement → test → commit
- Testing: Write tests first, fail fast
- Documentation: Use emojis for visual scanning

## 🔗 Usage
To use this configuration:
```bash
ln -sf ~/Personal/coding/claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```
